> *Investigating the spatio-temporal relationship of different climate variables with the spread of SARS -CoV2 using GIS and multivariate regressions.*
>
> In this project the students will be acquiring and processing several time series data of different geospatial climate variables including temperature and soil moisture along with population density and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) data for the United States and the entire Globe. The processed spatio-temporal climate variables, population density, and the SARS-CoV2 data will be analyzed in GIS environment to investigate how they relate to each other. The relationships will be studied at both local and regional scale using multivariate regressions. The students will be work remotely and will need efficient Laptop and internet to accomplish the proposed tasks.
